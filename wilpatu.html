    <div class="about">
        <p>Wilpattu is Sri Lanka's largest national park with an area of 130,000 hectare.
             It is also the oldest national park which has been reopened after several years of 
             closure due to the armed conflict in the country. A few decades ago it was Wilpattu 
             that was known ahead of Yala for its Leopard population. A unique feature of Wilpattu 
             national park is that the entire park is dotted with large sand rimmed natural lakes known 
             as “Villus”. The Villus collects rain water and tends to attract wildlife especially during 
             the times of drought.

            The main draw in Wilpattu is the leopard and sloth bear. It is also one of the better parks to 
            see barking deer. Wilpattu is bounded to the north and south by 2 main rivers, the Modara Gamaru
            owards the north of the park and the Kala Oya to the south of the park </p>

        <p>Should you visit it?</p>

    <div class="content">
        <p> Since Wilpattu National Park is one of the best safari parks in Sri Lanka, we recommend you
            to do a jeep safari in Wilpattu National Park. Wilpattu National Park is one of 2 National Parks
            in Sri Lanka where you can witness Sri Lankan Leopard (Panthera Paradus Kotiya). If you access
            Yala National Park during your holiday, you may skip Wilpattu. 
            But, If you are on your wildlife photography tour or wildlife educational field trip to Sri Lanka,
            Wilpattu National park is a MUST. </p>
