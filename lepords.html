            The Leopard (Panthera pardus, Linnaeus, 1758) is the most 
            secretive and elusive of the large carnivores, and also 
            the shrewdest. Pound for pound, it is the strongest climber
            of the larger cats and is capable of killing prey far 
            larger than itself. However, the leopard is the smallest
            member of the genus Panthera.
            There are Several where places where Lepords can be spoted for example:
            <ul>
                <li>Yala</li>
                <li>Wilpattu National Park</li>
                <li>Udawalawe National Park</li>
            </ul>

           <p>The survival of the Sri Lankan leopard is primarily threatened by increasing habitat loss and fragmentation,
             together with an increasing risk of human-induced mortality. They are also occasionally shot. Since 2010, over 90 
             leopards are known to have been killed by people in Sri Lanka.

            <p>Snars Traps: TSnares are the leading cause of death among Sri Lanka's leopards, accounting for 42 
                recorded deaths in the past 10 years. The most recent death was of a rare black leopard, which succumbed
                 to its injuries three days after getting snared, prompting public outrage over the use of snares.
                 nares are technically banned in Sri Lanka, but an exception is allowed for trapping “pest species” 
                 such as wild boars; however, the indiscriminate nature of the devices means that all wildlife are potential targets</p>
