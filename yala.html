    <div class="about">
        <p>The Yala National Park in Sri Lanka is one of the island's 
        oldest national parks, first opening in 1900 as a wildlife
        sanctuary and later on in 1938, being recognised as a national
        park. Yala uniquely combines a strict nature reserve with a
        national park. With a protected area of over 130,000 
        hectares of light forests, scrubs, lagoons and lakes, 
        the park has been divided into 5 blocks.  But Yala keeps
        revealing so much - and let me tell you why. 

        Generally hot and dry at the Yala National Park, its 
        expansive landscape flaunts much biodiversity, from 
        savannah grasslands to dry monsoon forests - but more 
        interestingly, Yala is home to some really impressive 
        residents: the Sri Lankan leopard, Sri Lankan elephant 
        and Sri Lankan sloth bear - among many others. Hands 
        down though, the leopards of Yala are the stars here. 
        With a density of at least one leopard per square 
        kilometre, you have a great chance of sighting this 
        elusive cat at Yala - than anywhere else on the planet! </p>

        <p>The Safari</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Though you are allowed to take your own vehicle to the
             park taking a jeep safari in Yala National Park 
             Sri Lanka is most recommended. Yala safari jeeps are
            mostly operated by the locals and widely available.
            There are different brands / models with varying
            roadworthiness conditions. Yala Park has some 
            rough terrains and during rain, conditions may 
            become really challenging. Hence having a reliable
            jeep with suitable tyres, required accessories 
            like winch & high-lift jack for eventuality and 
            required tools, plus being driven by an 
            experienced, professional driver, will ensure 
            that your jeep safari in Yala National Park 
            Sri Lanka will be memorable. </p>

        Planning your wildlife safari in Sri Lanka can be challenging 
        - especially if you don't know where to start. Follow our guide
        and these useful tips and tricks for a great experience!
        <ul>
        <li>The best time to visit the park is at 6AM, as soon as it opens, 
        or after 4PM, when the animals emerge out of their shadowed hideaways 
        from the sun.</li>
        <li>The average temperature at the park hovers around 27 degrees Celsius, 
        although it can reach heights of 37 degrees during the dry season. Make 
        sure that you bring a  bottle of water along.</li>
        <li>If you haven’t arranged for any meals during an afternoon safari, try
         and bring your own packed lunches. However, remember that anything you bring 
         with you must be taken back. Do not litter the park, especially with plastic bottles
        and wrappers, or leave behind anything that could negatively affect 
        the park’s ecosystem.</li>
        <li>Do not leave the safety of your vehicle during the safari, unless
         specifically informed that it is safe to do so by your guide</li>
        </ul>
